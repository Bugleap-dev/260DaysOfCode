### üß† What I Learned Today:
Today was all about *decision-making* in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. I built a little game
recommender that suggests a card game based on the number of players and how difficult you want it to be

### üõ†Ô∏è What the Code Does:
- Asks the user:  
  - Do you want to play Multiplayer or Single-player?  
  - Do you want something Difficult or Easy?

- Based on the combo, it suggests a game:
  - **Difficult + Multiplayer** ‚Üí Poker  
  - **Difficult + Single-player** ‚Üí Klondike  
  - **Easy + Multiplayer** ‚Üí Hearts  
  - **Easy + Single-player (or other)** ‚Üí Clock  

Simple idea, but great practice for branching logic!
