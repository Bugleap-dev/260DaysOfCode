# CONTINUATION OF **LECURE 0: Function_Variable**

## **STRING**
* String is a sequence of characters, enclosed in single (''), double ("") and triple ('""')quotes.

-  * **STRING FUNCTION**: is any function that works with strings -either built in functions like len(),or methods like uppper().
   - * len(): returns the length of a sting.
   - * str(): converts other data types into string.
   - * type(): tells you the data type.

- * **STRING METHODS**:is a built-in function in python that you can use with strings to perform specific tasks like changing text, finding things or formatting. **Method** is a function that is associated with an object.**Functions** are independent and can work on different types of data, while methods are attached to objects and work only on that specific type.

   - * .strip(): is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. 
      - * .lstrip(): removes left space only.
      - * .rstrip(): removes right space only.
   - * capitalize(): convert the first character of a string and the rest to lowercases.
   - * .title(): capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string while converting the rest to lowercase. 
   - * .split(): is used to split a string into a list based in a separator(like a space or comma)

## - **INTEGER AND FLOAT**
- Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point, e.g, 1, -5, 100, 0, etc.
- Float are numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form, properly called a floating point value, e.g, 3.14, -0.5, 2.0, 1e3,3e5,etc.
