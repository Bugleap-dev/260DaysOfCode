### **Exercise 1: Temperature Converter**

**Question Prompt:**

> Write a Python program that asks the user to input a temperature, such as "36C" or "98.6F", and converts it to the other unit (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius). The program should:
> - Accept input with or without the degree symbol (e.g., "Â°C" or "C").
> - Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
> - Print the result rounded to two decimal places.

### **Exercise 2: Tip Calculator**

**Question Prompt:**

> Create a Python program that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill. The program should:
> - Ask for the total cost of the meal.
> - Ask what percentage tip you'd like to leave.
> - Ask how many people are splitting the bill.
> - Calculate the total bill with tip and divide it evenly.
> - Display the result rounded to 2 decimal places.

### **Exercise 3: Unit Converter**

**Question Prompt:**

> Write a Python program that converts kilometers to miles. The program should:
> - Ask the user to enter a distance in kilometers (e.g., "10km" or "10").
> - Accept input with or without the "km" unit.
> - Strip any unnecessary whitespace.
> - Convert the value to miles and print the result rounded to 3 decimal places.
> - Use a custom conversion formula (you used: `(km * 5) / 3.107`).

### **Exercise 4: Grocery List**

**Question Prompt:**

> Write a Python program that lets a user create a grocery list. The program should:
> - Continuously prompt the user to enter items.
> - Stop asking when the user types "done".
> - Display the final grocery list with each item numbered.
